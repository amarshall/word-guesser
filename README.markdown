# Word Guesser #

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/amarshall/word-guesser.png)](http://travis-ci.org/amarshall/word-guesser)

This was originally designed as a simple tool to automate the generation of word possibilities given known letters in the word and known letters not in the word. The motivation for this was a programming exercise that came out of the task of manually creating lists of possible words for certain word games. It eventually evolved into having actual dictionary lookups, as generating millions of combinations becomes prohibitively expensive.
